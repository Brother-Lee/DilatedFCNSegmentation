1. Open the solver.prototxt again and rename the snapshot to 
             '/home/XYZ/Desktop/DilatedFCNSegmentation/Dilated_FCN-2s_VGG16/snapshot/voctraining'
2. Open both train.prototxt and val.prototxt and inside the 'Dilated_FCN-2s_VGG16' folder.
3. Rewrite the path to your VOC2012 dataset. For example :
      For train &  val   : /home/XYZ/Desktop/DilatedFCNSegmentation/Dilated_FCN-2s_VGG16/data/VOC2012
4. Download the data from [VOC2012 site](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/#data)
5. copy the VOC2012 directory to below folder.
             '/home/XYZ/Desktop/DilatedFCNSegmentation/Dilated_FCN-2s_VGG16/data/'
6. Run solvedilated.py for training
7. (Optional) you can resume training by the uncommenting line 13 and 16. And commenting line 12.
